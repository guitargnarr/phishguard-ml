---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Port (Default: 8000)

Edit `main.py` (line ~237):

## 🎯 ML Model Details

### Training Data (Version 2.0 - Comprehensive)
- **Dataset Size**: 5,000 samples (4,000 training / 1,000 testing)
- **Template Coverage**: 150+ patterns (vs 27 in v1.0)
- **Balance**: Perfectly balanced (50% phishing / 50% legitimate)
- **Training Script**: `train_ensemble_enhanced.py`

### Comprehensive Pattern Coverage

**Modern Phishing Tactics** (8 categories):
- ✅ Cryptocurrency scams
- ✅ COVID/health-related phishing
- ✅ Job offer scams
- ✅ Romance/dating scams
- ✅ Social media impersonation
- ✅ Two-factor authentication bypass attempts
- ✅ Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- ✅ Invoice/payment redirection scams

**Sophisticated Techniques** (6 categories):
- ✅ Spear phishing (personalized attacks)
- ✅ Multi-stage phishing (legitimate-looking first contact)
- ✅ QR code phishing
- ✅ Voice phishing (vishing) transcripts
- ✅ Unicode lookalike domains (punycode)
- ✅ HTML email with hidden content

**Language Diversity**:
- ✅ Typos and grammar errors (common in phishing)
- ✅ Regional variations (UK vs US English)

**Real-World Noise**:
- ✅ Marketing emails (hard to distinguish from spam)
- ✅ Legitimate security alerts (look similar to phishing)
- ✅ Forwarded emails with multiple layers

### Features (2,039 total)
- **2,000 TF-IDF features**: Text patterns, n-grams (1-3), word importance
- **39 Advanced features**:
  - Email text TF-IDF features
  - URL patterns and reputation checking
  - Domain characteristics (TLD, typosquatting)
  - Urgency keywords and sentiment scoring
  - Spelling errors and grammar quality
  - Link density and suspicious patterns
  - Capitalization and punctuation analysis
  - Email length and structure

### Model Performance (Ensemble v2.0)
- **Algorithms**: 7-model ensemble
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- **Voting**: Soft voting (probability-based)
- **Test Accuracy**: 100% (on comprehensive test set)
- **Precision**: 100%
- **Recall**: 100%
- **F1 Score**: 100%
- **AUC-ROC**: 1.000

**Note**: 100% accuracy is achieved on synthetic template-based data. Real-world deployment would show lower accuracy (~95-98%) due to novel phishing patterns not in training data. For production, consider:
- Integrating public phishing databases (PhishTank, APWG)
- Using pre-trained transformer models (BERT for phishing detection)
- Implementing continuous learning from user feedback

### Model Files
- **Ensemble Model**: 102 MB (`models/ensemble/ensemble_model.pkl`)
- **Vectorizer**: 85 KB (TF-IDF text transformer)
- **Feature Extractor**: 934 B (advanced features)
- **Scaler**: 48 KB (feature normalization)
- **scikit-learn**: 1.6.1 (CRITICAL: version must match for model loading)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Python Version
**CRITICAL**: Must use **Python 3.9.6** (`/usr/bin/python3`)

This system has a broken Python 3.13 installation. Always use the venv via `./run.sh`.

### scikit-learn Version
**CRITICAL**: Models trained with **scikit-learn 1.6.1**

Using a different version will cause warnings or errors. The venv is configured with the correct version.

### Model Files
- `models/phishing_clf.pkl` (5.9K)
- `models/tfidf_vec.pkl` (27K)

**WARNING**: Never load `.pkl` files from untrusted sources (arbitrary code execution risk).

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### For Development
- API runs on localhost only
- No authentication required
- Logs security events to CSV

### For Production
Before deploying, add:
- ✅ API Key Authentication
- ✅ Rate Limiting
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS
- ✅ CORS Configuration
- ✅ Input Validation
- ✅ Secure logging (don't log sensitive data)

See FastAPI security docs: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/

---

## 📊 Performance

### Response Times
- Health check: <10ms
- Email classification: 20-50ms
- Batch processing: 50-200ms

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~200 MB (with loaded models)
- CPU: <5% idle, ~20% during classification
- Startup time: 2-3 seconds

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check port availability
lsof -ti:8000

# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill

# Or run on different port (edit main.py)
```

### Models not loading
```bash
# Check models exist
ls -lh models/

# Retrain if missing
source venv/bin/activate
python train_model.py
deactivate
```

### Version mismatch warnings
```bash
# Check scikit-learn version
./venv/bin/python -c "import sklearn; print(sklearn.__version__)"
# Should output: 1.6.1

# Reinstall if needed
./venv/bin/pip install scikit-learn==1.6.1
```

For more troubleshooting, see **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

## 📦 Portability

To move to another machine:

1. Copy entire project folder
2. On new machine:
   ```bash
   cd security-phishing-detector
   rm -rf venv  # Remove old venv (hardcoded paths)
   python3.9 -m venv venv  # Create new venv
   ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
   ./run.sh
   ```
