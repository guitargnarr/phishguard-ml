## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3.9 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
5. Check code style: `flake8 . && black --check .`
6. Commit: `git commit -m "feat: your feature"`
7. Push and create Pull Request

## Code Style
